I recently launched my own custom software development agency and have already secured three clients. It's been a learning experience.

One key takeaway has been the importance of clear communication. Early on, I realized that setting expectations upfront helps prevent misunderstandings later. For instance, with one client, we defined the project scope in detail, which allowed us to stay aligned throughout development. 

Another insight is the value of building strong relationships. Each of my clients has different needs, and taking the time to understand their goals has made our collaborations much more effective. 

As I look to scale, Iâ€™m considering how to balance quality with growth. Iâ€™d love to hear how others have navigated this challenge. What strategies have worked for you?
